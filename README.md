# Front-end engineering challenge

For this challenge I built a small consent collector. It's basically two
components, a form for collecting consents and a table displaying them.

As part of the requirements I used material's UI data grid component which takes care of
the table. I originally did build the table myself along with server-side
pagination which is still available somewhere in the commit history.

For styling I used CSS modules with SASS.

I used a flat project structure, preferring clearly named components and files
to a nested structure, it makes the entire project easy to follow.
